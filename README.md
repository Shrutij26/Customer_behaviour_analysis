🛒 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

🌟 Project Overview

This project dives deep into a transactional dataset of 3,900 purchases across various product categories. The goal was to uncover hidden spending patterns, identify distinct customer segments, and understand subscription behaviors to help drive smarter business strategies.



🛠️ Tech Stack


Python (Pandas): Used for heavy-duty data cleaning, handling missing values, and initial exploration. 🐍


PostgreSQL: Served as the backbone for structured data storage and complex business queries. 🐘



Power BI: Used to build a sleek, interactive dashboard for visual storytelling. 📊

📊 Dataset Insights

The data consisted of 18 columns covering demographics, purchase details, and shopping behaviors.


Data Cleaning: I addressed 37 missing values in the Review Rating column by using the median rating of each category. 🧼1


Feature Engineering: Created a new age_group column to better categorize shoppers and a purchase_frequency_days metric. 🛠️


Gender Trends: Total revenue from male customers reached $157,890, while female customers contributed $75,191. 💰



Segmentation: I classified users into three groups: Loyal (3,116), Returning (701), and New (83). 👥


📈 Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard reveals some fascinating high-level metrics:


Average Purchase Amount: $59.76. 💵


Average Review Rating: 3.75 stars. ⭐


Subscription Status: Only 27% of our customers are currently subscribers, leaving a massive 73% as non-subscribers. 🎟️



Shipping Preference: Express shipping users spend slightly more on average ($60.48) compared to standard shipping users ($58.46). 🚚

💡 Business Recommendations


Subscription Push: Launch a campaign to convert the 73% of non-subscribers by offering exclusive perks. 🚀



Loyalty Rewards: Develop a program specifically to move "Returning" customers into the "Loyal" segment. 🎁



Smart Discounting: Keep an eye on products like Hats, which have a 50% discount rate, to ensure margins stay healthy. 🧢
